# Description
The Doubly Linked List project is an implementation of a doubly linked list data structure written in the C programming language. It provides a robust and efficient way to store and manipulate data in a linear, sequential manner. The project aims to demonstrate the functionality and versatility of a doubly linked list and serves as a learning resource for understanding its operations.

# Features
Creation and Deletion: The project allows for the creation of a doubly linked list and supports efficient deletion of nodes from the list.
Insertion: Nodes can be inserted at the beginning, end, or at a specific position within the list, providing flexibility in managing the data.
Traversal: The project enables traversing the doubly linked list in both forward and backward directions, facilitating easy access to the stored data.
Search: Users can search for specific elements within the list, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.
Modification: The project supports modifying the data stored in the nodes, enabling users to update values as needed.
Sorting: The project includes sorting algorithms to arrange the elements in the doubly linked list in ascending or descending order based on a selected attribute.
Memory Management: Proper memory management techniques are implemented to ensure efficient allocation and deallocation of memory resources.
